Sites :
There could be a loading bar for long operations.

Zones :
This one should be implemented at some point but not yet.

Paths :
Segments within a path are allowed to be disjoint, so when clicking four times (eg A[1,1]B[1,2]C[2,1]D[2,2]) that should create two segments (between A and B, then C and D) for the same path but not connect B and C. That means paths are made of segments with starts and ends, not just a list of points.
There should be an option on the left menu that defines current placement and pathfinding type. "ends" should only snap segment start and end but not subdivide into smaller segments, "shortest" would be what how currently works, "flattest" would minimize slopes (eg when climbing a mountain it would do several diagonals like most real world roads instead of climbing straight).

Struct :
there should be a slider for structure size (for the next structs to be placed).
Structures should be able to be places either side of paths (closer to the mouse cursor), not just one side.
There should be a hierarchy of things the structures should be allowed to snap to.
Paths first, other structures next, then frontier between land and water, then there will be more of those but we'll get to it later.

Labels :
Sites outlines should not appear here.
Label should be attributed to one or more elements on the map, or more arbitrarily placed.
Display a list of editable labels to the right side same logic than for paths tab, we'll use it later to highlight associated elements and display logic.

Rendering :
Zones should only display zone colors, not water. Water is already handles by the water checkbox.
Water should be darker overall, especially the lighter shades of it are currently too light.
Path and labels should be displayed on top of zones and water.
