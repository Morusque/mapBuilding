// this TODO file has tasked marked as (now) (soon) (later) from more urgent to less
// done tasks should be marked as (done) for review before I delete them

Loading bar :

Sites :
(later) there could be a "subdivide" button that splits each existing site in subregions (eg draws center to edges lines).
(later) anything snapped to sites should move along with them when moved or resnapped to closer site when regenerated
(later) poisson-disc doesn't seem to work anymore (but unless we can optimize it a lot, it would be ok to remove it)

Elevation :

Biomes :
(later) extend or shrink current biome button
(later) add a "create beaches" using current biome
(later) use techtonic logic in addition to perlin

Zones :
(later) options to allow overlapping or not (two groups? allowed / not-allowed)
(later) zone-painting brush is currently buggy

Paths :
(later) width definer similar to water but using pathfinding to define more important roads
(later) taping sometimes wrong (probably needs doubly connected edges and propagation done right)
(later) option to generate paths

Struct :
(later) structures should be groupable
(later) structure should snap to zones
(later) there should be checkboxes to what the structures can snap to: water, biomes, underwater biomes, zones, paths, other structures (only show snapping feedback overlay lines when snapping for a given feature is enabled)
(later) option to generate structs
(later) a way to move already placed structs
(later) refine the way parameters work (UI, default, selected, etc)

Labels :
(later) optionally associate labels with map elements
(later) have type presets for label styles (like with path types)
(later) text size should be handled better (typo appears blurry)
(later) option to generate labels

Rendering :
(later) zones should have options to be replaced by pattern of items (eg place trees for forest instead of green color).
(later) elevation lightning could feel more gradient-like or dither-like rather than just unified polygons (already done but disabled, needs refinement)
(later) Respect LOD rules: constant stroke widths, hide/show groups vs members depending on zoom, optional merging visually of dense structures.
(later) black and white mode should be more of a "bitmap" with no greyscale (replace them with patterns and lines if needed).
(later) Exporting the legend for reference.
(later) Comments exportable as custom format
(later) refine the precise way contours work
(later) find a way to allow for labels text fill color and outline color, also parameters for font used (just a few typical options)
(later) take inspiration from real map pictures
(later) outer padding

Editable types :
(later) Visually show which parameters "belong" to a type or to a more general part of the interface.

Export :
(later) JSON export/import (human-readable) with legend, layers, cells, paths, structures, groups, labels, view defaults.
(later) SVG export with layers (background, borders, paths, structures, labels, legend) and data-* / class attributes for type ids.
(later) are there existing formats for such tools to handle?

General :
(later) Refactor, optimize etc.
(later) Multithreading could be used for cpu intensive tasts such as pathfinding or voronoi.
(later) option to generate details (about everything) for zooming
(later) very top panel should have a little bit more padding on the bottom, jus a few px to allow bottom of text to be good visually
(soon) check useless variables, caching, problems tabs and stuff like those
(soon) scrollbars for long right-panel lists
(soon) MapModel.pde file is very long, could it be subdivided? (might be hard since single class)
