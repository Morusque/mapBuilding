(next) : revise rendering presets, make sure everything can be bitmap
(later) Zones : options to allow overlapping or not (two groups? allowed / not-allowed)
(later) Zones : use polygon tracing as an alternative to brush
(later) Paths : refine the way path generation works
(later) Paths : option to have the color match with water
(later) Paths : allow invisible (except on paths mode) path type (which means having alpha slider probably)
(later) Structures : structures should be groupable
(later) Structures : shrink big left menu a little
(later) Structures : crosses (as on treasure maps)
(later) Structures : use pictures instead of structs
(later) Export : path rendering slightly differ from their rendering in rendering mode (should be similar)
(later) Export : rendering shoud look exactly like the picture to be rendered (including points on paths and resolution, this should be cached, use loading bar)
(later) Rendering : mountain/forest/etc rendering style: use billboarded (mount/trees etc) tiles
(later) Rendering : join segments (eg zones outlines) in a nicer way
(later) Rendering :parametrable label outline (per label type)
(later) Rendering :better paths labels
(later) Rendering :LOD rules: hide/show groups vs members depending on zoom, optional merging visually of dense structures.
(later) Rendering : Rendering/exporting the legend for reference.
(later) Rendering : take inspiration from real map pictures (eg ign maps)
(later) Rendering : ripple lines are approximative, so either we optimize them or we make tem display below lands. make sure water contour lines never cross actual coastline
(later) Rendering : make outline display apply to all kinds of outlines that share the same border all-together at once
(later) Rendering : parametrable label font (per label type)
(later) Rendering : label size (per label type) should be handled better (typo appears blurry)
(later) Rendering : parametrable label color fill (per label type)
(later) Rendering : water contour lines distance should be zoom-dependant
(later) Rendering : structures sat and alpha variables exist but show no slider
(later) Rendering : push labels so they don't overlap, cache positions
(later) Other : investigate caching options, Refactor, optimize etc.
(later) Other : undo states
(later) Other : the way ui elements are stored should be a box containing the labels as well, not having the labels partially above it (eg see how HSB sliders are inserted in the layout)
(later) Other : Update comments to multiline
(later) Other : make the generations better overall
(maybe) Sites : there could be a "subdivide" button that splits each existing site in subregions (eg draws center to edges lines).
(maybe) Sites : anything snapped to sites should move along with them when moved or resnapped to closer site when regenerated
(maybe) Elevation : use techtonic logic or vector field displacement in addition to perlin or double multiplied perlin
(maybe) Paths : width definer similar to water but using pathfinding to define more important roads
(maybe) Structures : use polygon tracing as a structure input mode
(maybe) Export : importing from picture
(maybe) Rendering : a "save preset" button
(maybe) use HSB directly instead of converting?
