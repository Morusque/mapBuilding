Loading bar :

Sites :
(later) there could be a "subdivide" button that splits each existing site in subregions (eg draws center to edges lines).
(later) should probably be called "grid" and "cell" instead of sites/site, at least in the UI, ideally in the code as well
(later) anything snapped to sites should move along with them when moved or resnapped to closer site when regenerated

Elevation :

Biomes :
(later) extend or shrink current biome button
(later) add a "create beaches" using current biome

Zones :
(later) a first-pass has been done but we need to redo this in a lot more specific way

Paths :
(later) needs more optimization
(later) to prevent hanging could we start with straightforward route and each frame refine it to comply with parameters?
(later) width definer similar to water but using pathfinding to define more important roads

Struct :
(later) structures should be groupable
(later) some ui on the right panel for per-struct parameters (can be displayed once for selected struct)

Labels :
(later) Label should be attributed to one or more elements on the map, or more arbitrarily placed.
(later) use label types as layers to display only certains things and associate labels to them
(later) Label types with default style; attach to cells/paths/structures/groups or free position; anchor controls; option to follow path curvature.

Rendering :
(later) zones should have options to be replaced by pattern of items (eg place trees for forest instead of green color).
(later) elevation lightning could feel more gradient-like or dither-like rather than just unified polygons.
(later) Respect LOD rules: constant stroke widths, hide/show groups vs members depending on zoom, optional merging visually of dense structures.
(later) black and white mode should be more of a "bitmap" with no greyscale (replace them with patterns and lines if needed).
(later) Exporting the legend for reference.
(later) Comments exportable as custom format
(later) refine the precise way contours work

Editable types :
(later) Visually show which parameters "belong" to a type or to a more general part of the interface.

Export :
(later) JSON export/import (human-readable) with legend, layers, cells, paths, structures, groups, labels, view defaults.
(later) SVG export with layers (background, borders, paths, structures, labels, legend) and data-* / class attributes for type ids.

General :
(later) Define a precise lexicon and homogenize code and ui labels.
(later) Refactor, optimize etc.
(later) Multithreading could be used for cpu intensive tasts such as pathfinding or voronoi.
(later) MapModel.pde file is very long, could it be subdivided? (might be hard since single class)
(later) option to generate details (about everything) for zooming
