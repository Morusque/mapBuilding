Loading bar :
(later) Try to optimize further.

Sites :
(later) There could be a "subdivide" button that splits each existing site in subregions (eg draws center to edges lines).
(later) should probably be called "grid" and "cell" instead of sites/site, at least in the UI, ideally in the code as well

Elevation :

Biomes :

Zones :
(later) a first-pass has been done but we need to redo this in a lot more specific way

Paths :
(maybe later) paths (typically rivers) could have an option that make them start small and end bigger when reaching the sea (this needs connection analysis, pathfinding etc when using multiple segments, to compute segment proximity to sea, parameter weight would be the bigger weight next to the sea).
(later) needs more optimization
(later) to prevent hanging could we start with straightforward route and each frame refine it to comply with parameters?

Struct :
(maybe later) add other kind of structures : rectangles, regular polygons, circles, all with appropriate sliders if needed.
(maybe later) structres should be removable, grouppable, and displayed as a list.
(later) snapping magnetism should probably be zoom-invarient (so that if we need more precision we can zoom and the snap is relatively smaller)

Labels :
(later) Label should be attributed to one or more elements on the map, or more arbitrarily placed.
(later) use label types as layers to display only certains things and associate labels to them
(later) Label types with default style; attach to cells/paths/structures/groups or free position; anchor controls; option to follow path curvature.

Rendering :
(later) water should have a "contour lines" option (based on proximity from coastline).
(later) elevation should have a "contour lines" option (based on elevation landmarks).
(later) zones should have options to be replaced by pattern of items (eg place trees for forest instead of green color).
(later) elevation lightning could feel more gradient-like or dither-like rather than just unified polygons.
(later) Respect LOD rules: constant stroke widths, hide/show groups vs members depending on zoom, optional merging visually of dense structures.
(later) black and white mode should be more of a "bitmap" with no greyscale (replace them with patterns and lines if needed).
(later) Exporting the legend for reference.
(later) Comments exportable as custom format

Editable types : (for anywhere applicable: paths, biomes, etc)
(later) Visually show which parameters "belong" to a type or to a more general part of the interface.

Export :
(later) JSON export/import (human-readable) with legend, layers, cells, paths, structures, groups, labels, view defaults.
(later) SVG export with layers (background, borders, paths, structures, labels, legend) and data-* / class attributes for type ids.

General :
(later) Define a precise lexicon and homogenize code and ui labels.
(later) Refactor, optimize etc.
(later) Multithreading could be used for cpu intensive tasts such as pathfinding or voronoi.
(later) MapModel.pde file is very long, could it be subdivided? (might be hard since single class)
(maybe later) on each panel, find a place to write non UI controls (role mouse buttons, wheel, keys such as DEL etc)
(later) option to generate details (about everything) for zooming
