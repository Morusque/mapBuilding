Zones :
This one should be implemented at some point but not yet.

Paths :
Path weight will be path-specific, not global.
Right side of screen should show a list of existing distinct paths along with data (number of segments, total length) and parameters (radius, type, name).
Water should be visible here.

Struct :
there should be a slider for structure size (for the next structs to be placed).
Structures should be able to be places either side of paths (closer to the mouse cursor), not just one side.
There should be a hierarchy of things the structures should be allowed to snap to.
Paths first, other structures next, then frontier between land and water, then there will be more of those but we'll get to it later.

Labels :
Label should be attributed to one or more elements on the map, or more arbitrarily placed.
Display a list of editable labels to the right side same logic than for paths tab, we'll use it later to highlight associated elements and display logic.

Rendering :
Zones should only display zone colors, not water. Water is already handles by the water checkbox.
Water should be darker overall, especially the lighter shades of it are currently too light.
Path and labels should be displayed on top of zones and water.
