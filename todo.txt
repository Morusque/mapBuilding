Loading bar :

Sites :
(later) there could be a "subdivide" button that splits each existing site in subregions (eg draws center to edges lines).
(later) anything snapped to sites should move along with them when moved or resnapped to closer site when regenerated

Elevation :

Biomes :
(later) extend or shrink current biome button
(later) add a "create beaches" using current biome

Zones :
(now) make the generation depend more on whatever is already on the map (eg propagation priority lowered by biome change, big elevation changes, etc)
(now) allow shared borders to be seen for both zones
(later) options to allow overlapping or not (groups?)

Paths :
(later) needs more optimization or threading so not to hang anything
(later) to prevent hanging could we start with straightforward route and each frame refine it to comply with parameters?
(soon) other optimization possibility : make route start from both ends of the path and check when they connect
(later) width definer similar to water but using pathfinding to define more important roads
(later) taping sometimes wrong (probably needs doubly connected edges and propagation done right)
(now) tweak default values for river (wider, taper on)
(now) put eraser back
(soon) refine logic for types (and show colors on the right side menu)
(soon) assign placing strategies to types

Struct :
(later) structures should be groupable
(soon) some ui on the right panel for per-struct parameters (can be displayed once on top of the list for selected struct): name, size, type, angle, color (allow transparent)
(later) structure should snap to zones
(later) there should be checkboxes to what the structures can snap to: water, biomes, underwater biomes, zones, paths, other structures (only show snapping feedback overlay lines when snapping for a given feature is enabled)

Labels :
(now) Label should be attributed to one or more elements on the map, or more arbitrarily placed, with assiciated default values (revise the way this was done)
(now) use label types as layers to display only certains things and associate labels to them

Rendering :
(later) zones should have options to be replaced by pattern of items (eg place trees for forest instead of green color).
(soon) elevation lightning could feel more gradient-like or dither-like rather than just unified polygons.
(later) Respect LOD rules: constant stroke widths, hide/show groups vs members depending on zoom, optional merging visually of dense structures.
(later) black and white mode should be more of a "bitmap" with no greyscale (replace them with patterns and lines if needed).
(later) Exporting the legend for reference.
(later) Comments exportable as custom format
(later) refine the precise way contours work
(later) find a way to allow for labels text fill color and outline color, also parameters for font used (just a few typical options)
(later) take inspiration from real map pictures

Editable types :
(later) Visually show which parameters "belong" to a type or to a more general part of the interface.

Export :
(soon) create a new tab and .pde files for this (empty at first, I'll specity many things about)
(later) JSON export/import (human-readable) with legend, layers, cells, paths, structures, groups, labels, view defaults.
(later) SVG export with layers (background, borders, paths, structures, labels, legend) and data-* / class attributes for type ids.

General :
(later) Refactor, optimize etc.
(later) Multithreading could be used for cpu intensive tasts such as pathfinding or voronoi.
(soon) MapModel.pde file is very long, could it be subdivided? (might be hard since single class)
(later) option to generate details (about everything) for zooming
(soon) ui indications could be more than two lines instead of using "; "
(later) very top panel should have a little bit more padding on the bottom, jus a few px to allow bottom of text to be good visually
