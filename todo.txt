Zones :
This one should be implemented at some point but not yet.

Paths :
Water and elevation should be visible here on this mode.
It should not be allowed to draw paths outside of the map.
Closing the path should not be a step, the "Close (Enter)" button should not exist. The path should be closed by itself at every step (click). The next click then restarts a new list of segment, then the next one closes it etc.
The currently added segment should be visible as a preview even before the "close" click.
"Path weight (px)" slider should not exist. Instead, every path in the right list should have a selectable "type" attribute.
Types should appear on the left menu, in the same way than biomes do, and have three editable attributes: label (eg "road", "street", "river", "wall"), color, weight.
Specific Paths labels ("Path 1") should be editable.
A path is made of a list of segments, those segments don't necessarily have to be conjoint.
There should be a "new" button on the Path list, and a "delete" on each path item.

Struct :
there should be a slider for structure size (for the next structs to be placed).
Structures should be able to be places either side of paths (closer to the mouse cursor), not just one side.
There should be a hierarchy of things the structures should be allowed to snap to.
Paths first, other structures next, then frontier between land and water, then there will be more of those but we'll get to it later.

Labels :
Label should be attributed to one or more elements on the map, or more arbitrarily placed.
Display a list of editable labels to the right side same logic than for paths tab, we'll use it later to highlight associated elements and display logic.

Rendering :
Zones should only display zone colors, not water. Water is already handles by the water checkbox.
Water should be darker overall, especially the lighter shades of it are currently too light.
Path and labels should be displayed on top of zones and water.
