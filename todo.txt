// this TODO file has tasked marked as (now) (soon) (later) from more urgent to less
// done tasks should be marked as (done) for review before I delete them

Loading bar :

Sites :
(later) there could be a "subdivide" button that splits each existing site in subregions (eg draws center to edges lines).
(later) anything snapped to sites should move along with them when moved or resnapped to closer site when regenerated

Elevation :
(later) use techtonic logic in addition to perlin
(later) extend water slider range so we can completely make water disappear or fill the whole screen

Biomes :
(soon) use selectable generation method for "generate" button : propagation, reset, fill gaps, beaches, mountains, extend, shrink, full

Zones :
(later) options to allow overlapping or not (two groups? allowed / not-allowed)
(later) remove/reserve water from zones
(later) small zones isolated artifacts
(later) make zone display look somehow better

Paths :
(later) width definer similar to water but using pathfinding to define more important roads
(later) taping sometimes wrong (probably needs doubly connected edges and propagation done right)
(later) option to generate paths
(soon) when switchg path type on the left menu, desselect the path (on the right menu)

Struct :
(later) structures should be groupable
(later) structure should snap to zones
(later) option to generate structs
(later) a way to move already placed structs
(later) refine the way parameters work (UI, default, selected, etc)
(later) structures light shading on rendering mode

Labels :
(later) optionally associate labels with map elements
(later) have type presets for label styles (like with path types)
(later) option to generate labels
(later) find a way to allow for labels text fill color and outline color, also parameters for font used (just a few typical options)
(later) text size should be handled better (typo appears blurry)

Rendering :
(later) biomes should have options to be replaced by pattern of items (eg place trees for forest instead of green color).
(later) elevation lightning could feel more gradient-like or dither-like rather than just unified polygons (already done but disabled, needs refinement)
(later) LOD rules: hide/show groups vs members depending on zoom, optional merging visually of dense structures.
(later) black and white mode should be more of a "bitmap" with no greyscale (replace them with patterns and lines if needed), should be done per-element and single button removed
(later) Exporting the legend for reference.
(later) Comments exportable as custom format
(later) refine the precise way contours work
(later) take inspiration from real map pictures (eg ign maps)
(later) add loading bars for long operations (contours)
(later) don't show cell borders unless specified
(later) some ugly dots appear sometimes between polygones

Editable types :
(later) Visually show which parameters "belong" to a type or to a more general part of the interface.

Export :
(later) JSON export/import (human-readable) with legend, layers, cells, paths, structures, groups, labels, view defaults.
(later) SVG export with layers (background, borders, paths, structures, labels, legend) and data-* / class attributes for type ids.
(later) are there existing formats for such tools to handle?

General :
(later) investigate caching options
(later) option to generate details (about everything) for zooming
(later) Refactor, optimize etc.
(later) remove comments specific to explain a single commit, add general purpose comments instead
(later) remove obsolete debug prints
(later) undo states
(later) rgbToHSB seems to be part of the model class while hsb01ToRGB isnt, also why "01"? can we add more clarity to all this?
