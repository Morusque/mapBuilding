// this TODO file has tasked marked as (now) (soon) (later) from more urgent to less
// done tasks should be marked as (done) for review before I delete them

Loading bar :

Sites :
(later) there could be a "subdivide" button that splits each existing site in subregions (eg draws center to edges lines).
(later) anything snapped to sites should move along with them when moved or resnapped to closer site when regenerated

Elevation :

Biomes :
(later) extend or shrink current biome button
(later) add a "create beaches" using current biome
(later) use techtonic logic in addition to perlin

Zones :
(later) options to allow overlapping or not (two groups? allowed / not-allowed)
(later) zone-painting brush is currently buggy
(soon) when creating new zone, use a new hue that is as distant as possible as any other zone hue already present

Paths :
(later) needs more optimization or threading so not to hang anything
(later) to prevent hanging could we start with straightforward route and each frame refine it to comply with parameters?
(soon) other optimization possibility : make route start from both ends of the path and check when they connect
(later) width definer similar to water but using pathfinding to define more important roads
(later) taping sometimes wrong (probably needs doubly connected edges and propagation done right)
(soon) when a path is being selected, also automatically select the associated type in the left menu

Struct :
(later) structures should be groupable
(soon) some ui on the right panel for per-struct parameters (can be displayed once on top of the list for selected struct): name, size, type, angle, color (allow transparent)
(later) structure should snap to zones
(later) there should be checkboxes to what the structures can snap to: water, biomes, underwater biomes, zones, paths, other structures (only show snapping feedback overlay lines when snapping for a given feature is enabled)

Labels :
(soon) Label should be attributed to one or more elements on the map, or more arbitrarily placed, with associated default values (revise the way this was done)
(soon) use label types as layers to display only certains things and associate labels to them
(soon) label naming doesn't seem to work anymore

Rendering :
(later) zones should have options to be replaced by pattern of items (eg place trees for forest instead of green color).
(soon) elevation lightning could feel more gradient-like or dither-like rather than just unified polygons.
(later) Respect LOD rules: constant stroke widths, hide/show groups vs members depending on zoom, optional merging visually of dense structures.
(later) black and white mode should be more of a "bitmap" with no greyscale (replace them with patterns and lines if needed).
(later) Exporting the legend for reference.
(later) Comments exportable as custom format
(later) refine the precise way contours work
(later) find a way to allow for labels text fill color and outline color, also parameters for font used (just a few typical options)
(later) take inspiration from real map pictures
(later) outer padding

Editable types :
(later) Visually show which parameters "belong" to a type or to a more general part of the interface.

Export :
(later) JSON export/import (human-readable) with legend, layers, cells, paths, structures, groups, labels, view defaults.
(later) SVG export with layers (background, borders, paths, structures, labels, legend) and data-* / class attributes for type ids.
(later) are there existing formats for such tools to handle?

General :
(later) Refactor, optimize etc.
(later) Multithreading could be used for cpu intensive tasts such as pathfinding or voronoi.
(soon) MapModel.pde file is very long, could it be subdivided? (might be hard since single class)
(later) option to generate details (about everything) for zooming
(soon) ui indications could be more than two lines instead of using "; "
(later) very top panel should have a little bit more padding on the bottom, jus a few px to allow bottom of text to be good visually
(soon) list selections should feel more like win95 circular radio (beveled white hole, with black dot in it when selected)
