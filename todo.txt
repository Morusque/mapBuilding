Sites :
There could be a loading bar for long operations.

Zones :
This one should be implemented at some point but not yet.

Paths :
For now the menu on the left should contain only :
- "+/-" buttons : that adds/removes types based on a hardcoded list similar to Biomes (while currently deleted then respawned types fallback to TypeN labels).
- Selectable types with editable label, hue and weight.
For now the menu on the right should contain only :
- The list of Path, clicking on it (for instance on a bullet button) makes it selected (with visual feedback), it contains editable label, selectable type and delete button.
- bottom of the list is a "New Path" button that adds a path at the end.
The map : clicking the map alternatively starts and ends (validates) a new segment that gets added to the currently selected Path in the list (and not "as" a ne path).Closing the path should not be a step, the "Close (Enter)" button should not exist. The path should be closed by itself at every step (click). The next click then restarts a new list of segment, then the next one closes it etc.
The segment preview should take pathfinding into account.

Struct :
there should be a slider for structure size (for the next structs to be placed).
Structures should be able to be places either side of paths (closer to the mouse cursor), not just one side.
There should be a hierarchy of things the structures should be allowed to snap to.
Paths first, other structures next, then frontier between land and water, then there will be more of those but we'll get to it later.

Labels :
Sites outlines should not appear here.
Label should be attributed to one or more elements on the map, or more arbitrarily placed.
Display a list of editable labels to the right side same logic than for paths tab, we'll use it later to highlight associated elements and display logic.

Rendering :
Zones should only display zone colors, not water. Water is already handles by the water checkbox.
Water should be darker overall, especially the lighter shades of it are currently too light.
Path and labels should be displayed on top of zones and water.
